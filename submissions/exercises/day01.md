#### 1. UI and UX analyses for Day 1

_(just choose the questions you would like to answer and make it concise)_
<br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**User-Experience Analysis:**<br/>

-   Which website is easier to find the product you are looking for?<br/>
    Answer: Shoppee, because of the use of the graphical categories I find it easy to navigate through the different options for the product that I should look for. Compare to lazada that only has text for each categories.

-   Identify any distractions or unnecessary elements that could potentially confuse users.<br/>
    Answer: 
As for Shoppee:
The clickbait prices, clicking a product on the 'flash sale' and then previewing it will change the price.

As for Lazada:
The ad banner can confuse users because there is no button to shift the ads, the ads will only switch either in duration or hovering your cursor into the little dots that indicates the page.

-   Compare the organization of content between the two platforms. Which between the two platformsâ€™ content is easier to scan and understand?<br/>
    Answer: Comparing the two platforms, I find shoppee's hierarchal information very easy to grasp it also has consistent use of its color brand that makes the price pop which is the most significant aspect of this website.
As for lazada, I find myself distracted because the layout of the information is not emphasize and the image is smaller.

#### 2. An **optional** screenshot of playing the game **"It's Centred That"** and your feedback
-The game is really fun, It's not that easy and also it's not that hard (balanced). I think adding sfx and background music will make it perfect.
